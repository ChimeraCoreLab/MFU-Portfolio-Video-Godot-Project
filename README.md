This repository contains the complete and open-source Godot Engine project files for my 3-minute self-introduction video, created for my application to Mae Fah Luang University's (MFU) "Digital Technology for Business Innovation" program.

## // Core Philosophy

The goal of this project was to **show, not just tell**. Instead of a conventional application video, I chose to leverage the tools I am passionate about—game engines and creative coding—to build a visual narrative that embodies my skills and vision. Everything from the 3D environment and character animation to the holographic UI and final render was orchestrated within Godot.

It serves as a practical demonstration of my abilities in:
-   3D Scene Setup & Lighting in Godot 4
-   Complex animation sequencing using `AnimationPlayer`
-   Shader creation for visual effects (holograms, glitches)
-   Integration of audio and visual elements for storytelling

## // How to Use

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ChimeraCoreLab/MFU-Portfolio-Video-Godot-Project.git
    ```
2.  Open the project in **Godot Engine 4.5.1**.
3.  The main scene containing the entire animation timeline is `scenes/master_scene.tscn`.
4.  Open the `AnimationPlayer` node within that scene to explore the full timeline and all keyframed tracks.
